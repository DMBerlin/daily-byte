/**
 * This question is asked by Amazon.
 * 
 * Given two arrays of numbers, where the first array is a subset of the second array,
 * return an array containing all the next greater elements for each element in the first array,
 * in the second array. If there is no greater element for any element, output -1 for that number.
 * 
 * Ex: Given the following arraysâ€¦
 * 
 * nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2], return [-1, 3, -1]
 * because no element in nums2 is greater than 4, 3 is the first number in nums2 greater than 1,
 * and no element in nums2 is greater than 2.
 * 
 * nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4], return [3, -1]
 * because 3 is the first greater element that occurs in nums2 after 2 and no element is greater than 4.
